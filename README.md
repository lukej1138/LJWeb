## A Basic Website I Created To Showcase Projects

To check out the live version, go to: https://ljcoolportfolio.netlify.app

I build this project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Astro as a framework; it's the first website I've ever built, so there's definitely some room for improvement.

Currently the website is a bit laggy on Safari due to some large images/associated transitions; 
use Chrome for an optimal experience.
